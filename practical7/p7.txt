In this code:

The CountVectorizer class from sklearn.feature_extraction.text is used to implement the Bag of Words model. It converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
The TfidfVectorizer class from sklearn.feature_extraction.text is used to implement the TF-IDF model. It converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.
The fit_transform function learns the vocabulary dictionary and returns a Document-Term matrix.
The get_feature_names_out function returns an array mapping from feature integer indices to feature names.
Please replace 'This is the first document.', 'This document is the second document.', 'And this is the third one.', 'Is this the first document?' with your actual documents.
